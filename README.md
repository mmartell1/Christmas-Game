# Christmas-Game

# Concept:
	Overall objective of the game: save Christmas.
	Level 1: The goal of Level 1 is to collect points by collecting presents that bounce around the screen. There are 3 types of presents with varying speeds and point values. Each wave of presents contains a mix of the three.
	For each wave, out of the three types of presents, there is a specified type the player is told to collect, even if they are worth less than the fastest presents. Collecting a certain amount of that type of present for that wave increases your player’s max HP. This will help later in Level 2.
	The goal of Level 2 is to outlast Santa and save Christmas. The player has a health bar and their point counter from the previous level. Santa’s attacks are red presents that bounce around the screen which the player has to avoid.
	The presents lower both the player’s HP and points. Every couple of waves, the player has the option to regain either points or HP. Whichever they choose, for one wave, either green hearts or blue pluses will bounce around the screen along with red presents.
	The player has to make it to the end of the level by not dying. However, even if the player makes it to the end of the level, they still might not win the game. The player’s points have to be above a certain number in order to save Christmas.
	A difficulty level can be selected at the beginning of the game.

Levels and controls
For 1 player, the controls are the arrow keys. Left and right are used to move left and right, respectively, and the up arrow key is used to jump.
For 2 players, 1 person uses the arrow keys and the other uses WASD, with A and D corresponding to the left and right arrow keys, and the W to the up arrow key.

The first level consists of collecting presents for points.
The second level consists of using the points from the first level in order to outlast Santa and save Christmas. 

Multiple Objectives 
Level 1: The player has 2 objectives: to gain a higher max HP and to gain points.
Level 2: The player has to outlast Santa by keeping your HP above 0. They also have to “save Christmas” by keeping your points above a certain number. 

Multiplayer Support
If played with 2 players, the first level is competitive, and the second level is cooperative.
In Level 1, the players compete to get the most points. In Level 2, they work together in order to outlast Santa. If their combined amount of points is high enough, then they “save Christmas”. Since the points are combined, the amount of points required to save Christmas goes up in multiplayer. If one of the players has died but Christmas is still saved, they are revived.

Characters, Objects and/or Sprites
Characters include Player 1, Player 2, and Santa.
Objects:
Level 1: There are 3 types of presents collected for points. The first is blue, and it’s the biggest and slowest present. It’s worth the least amount of points.
The second is green, smaller than the blue present, moves faster, and is worth more than the blue present.
The third is purple, and it’s the smallest, moves the fastest, and is worth the most.

Level 2: In the Santa fight, the player must avoid red presents. They are the size of the green presents. Speed varies based on game difficulty. 
Earning back points/HP:
Health is earned by collecting small green hearts, points are earned by collecting small blue plus signs. The hearts and pluses have the same size and speed as the purple presents for the difficulty.

Overlay or status feedback
Level 1: There is a point counter for each player who is playing.There is also a full health bar, and the max HP possible can increase throughout this level.

Level 2: Max HP is fixed. The player has a health bar and a point counter. If there are 2 players, each player has an individual health bar, but the point counter counts the total number of points between them.

Experimental Feature 
At the beginning of the game, a difficulty from Easy, Medium, or Difficult can be selected.

Level 1: With each increase in difficulty, the presents are worth less points and move faster.

Level 2: In Easy difficulty, the red presents have the same speed as the green presents in that difficulty. In Medium, they have the same speed as the purple presents for that difficulty. In Difficult, they are faster than the purple presents.
Opportunities to gain back points or health occur less frequently for each increase in difficulty.
